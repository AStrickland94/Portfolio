                My name is Adam Strickland, I'm 28 years old and I'm currently
                living on the west side of Melbourne.
                <br /><br />
                I spend a lot of my time studying Japanese and playing music
                (guitar and piano).
                <br />
                Some of my other hobbies include: Reading, playing videogames,
                watching movies and going camping.
                <br /><br />
                I have spent most of my working life working a number of manual
                labour jobs for various companies large and small. The most
                recent being Virgin Australia Airlines where I worked for 3
                years as a baggage handler.
                <br /><br />
                I have always had a passion for tech. I love getting into fine
                detail to learn exactly how things work and finding the small
                interesting aspects that can be often overlooked, both in
                physical and digital mediums.
                <br /><br />
                I am looking forward to beginning my career in IT and all the
                great opportunities that will come with it.

                I currently have knowledge in HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript and
                Git.
